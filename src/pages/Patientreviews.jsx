        <p>I have had the best experience with Dr. Morgan and his staff over the past several months. They have made me feel comfortable at every appointment and are very easy to communicate with. I have struggled with my smile due to my small teeth and Dr. Morgan and his staff have been helping me get my dream smile. After each appointment I see significant results and have already received so many compliments by family and friends. Dr. Morgan and his staff always explain to me what they are doing and answer any questions or concerns I have. Going into college soon, they have made this process easy and manageable given my crazy schedule.<br/>

        <p>Almost losing my life in an accident left me not only permanently disabled but also with lots of damage to my teeth from the head and face trauma I sustained. Although I am just in the beginning stages with my treatment with Dr. Morgan due to the coronavirus delays and the need to work simultaneously with my orthodontist, I couldn‚Äôt be more excited for what is to come. I have heard amazing things about Dr. Morgan from my orthodontist‚Äôs office and, with the few times I have been there, Dr. Morgan had me feeling so calm and assured that I know I am in good hands. And the cleanings alone were the most relaxing cleanings ever!! Seriously‚Ä¶.his dental hygienist is the most gentle yet thorough dental hygienist you could ever imagine!!! üôÇ Thanks to Dr. Morgan and his amazing staff for helping me to get the smile I once had back again. I look forward to everything that is to come.<br/>

      <p>I am absolutely thrilled with the results from Dr. Morgan and his team! Backstory: this June, 2020 I had recently chipped the existing bonding off my front tooth (this was from an old chip in 2011 that had been repaired three times with a DIFFERENT dentist).<br/><br/>
So at 31 weeks pregnant, after being a client with my OLD dentist (in Chicago) since 2007, my OLD dentist would not see me until after I had the baby (completely healthy pregnancy btw, no issues here). So yeah, there‚Äôs nothing like waiting an additional NINE weeks to 1. Pray the chip doesn‚Äôt get worse and 2. Feel insecure when I was already uncomfortable to begin with.<br/><br/>
I knew there had to be someone that wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúafraid ‚Äú to work on my tooth because I was pregnant. I knew there had to be a professional that was grounded and had so many years of versatile experience, that working on a woman‚Äôs front tooth while she was pregnant would not be something he/she would shy away from, but rather lean into and want to provide care. That professional is Dr. Morgan. Dr. Morgan was clear, professional, warm, and confident. I could tell he was comfortable in his craft, thus making me feel at ease. Dr. Morgan‚Äôs team was incredible. The ladies were empathetic, fun, and full of talent. My tooth is BEAUTIFUL! No more chippy! I will now be able to welcome my son with a confident smile, and not have to feel embarrassed.<br/><br/>
I have now fully committed to Dentistry by Design, and will NEVER look back! Thank you, thank you üôèüèª<br/>

      <p>INCOMPARABLE!
Finding myself in need of a new dentist, I began the nerve-racking process of searching for the right fit. Dr. Morgan was high on the referral list. I was previously with a specialty dentist in downtown Chicago. I‚Äôm an oral cancer survivor with a history of multiple oral surgeries related to my cancer and extensive dental procedures. As a result, I‚Äôm extra anxious about someone even looking in my mouth, because frankly it just doesn‚Äôt look like everyone else‚Äôs.<br/><br/>
From the beginning, I experienced compassion, understanding, patience and a sense of calm from the entire staff. This did wonders to instill confidence and eased my nerves throughout my visit. Naomi, the hygienist, was thorough and very careful. She kindly and patiently talked me through every step as she progressed through my cleaning. Dr. Morgan was well aware of my history and incredibly thorough with my exam. I elected to have the full mouth cancer screening and he suggested the 2nd tier spot screening as I have one area that definitely needs to be watched carefully. I left that day with a sense of confidence and relief! I had the ‚Äúall clear‚Äù and with a few great new tips on how I can continue to maintain the best oral health possible for me. Ideas frankly I hadn‚Äôt heard before. It‚Äôs evident that the ‚Äúteam‚Äù at Dentistry By Design is up to date on the latest technology and education available.<br/><br/>
My next visit involved checking on a crown that had been giving me some concerns. Dr. Morgan took x-rays that clearly showed me where the problem was. My crown wasn‚Äôt salvageable and I set up a convenient appointment schedule to address the problem. I was a bit nervous prior to my next appointment as frankly, I hadn‚Äôt needed an oral injection for a few years. Dr. Morgan was so gentle, I didn‚Äôt even feel the needle! It‚Äôs obvious that Dr. Morgan and his assistant Jennifer, have embraced an incredible teamwork process! She seemed to read his mind, silently handing him instruments while successfully distracting me. Dr. Morgan, skillfully and deftly, progressed through the removal of my old failing crown and addressed the area of concern. Before long I was leaving with a beautiful temporary crown that was possibly nicer than my previous permanent crown! A couple weeks later I had a new permanent crown that matched my existing dental work perfectly and no more toothache!<br/><br/>
After these 2 successful visits, I suggested my college daughter visit Dr. Morgan‚Äòs office while home on break.
She was as thrilled with her experience as I was with mine. Now all my kids are patients and I‚Äôve referred several friends!<br/><br/>
This part of my review is really my favorite! I noticed while checking out, that Dentistry By Design was offering fillers, botox, and The Vampire Facelift! My interest was peaked because I had thought about how great my injection was when Dr. Morgan had given me anesthetic for my crown. At first, I was a little hesitant because I had never really considered a dentist doing anti-aging, botox, filers etc‚Ä¶..hmmmm‚Ä¶..After a conversation with a friend in Washington that works in healthcare/anti-aging, I learned that dentists actually are 2nd only to Facial-Plastic surgeons in their study and knowledge of the neural and muscle systems in the face. I thought this could be great! He was a fantastic injector and a reconstructive specialist!! Which meant he had studied form, structure and balance.All the tricky areas that can get really messed up with botox and fillers gone wrong! And haven‚Äôt we all seen enough of those:/ I have now had the Vampire Facelift, botox and a couple of filler injections at Dentistry By Design, I am SO happy!
Thank you to Dr. Morgan and his amazing staff!<br/>
